## About
A react calculator project from LambdaSchool that I wanted to continue working on and polish. The best way I've found to do this is to just create a new repo and work from here.

## Available Commands

After cloning / downloading, you must first run `yarn install` inside the project root.<br />
Afterwards, you can execute the scripts below to run locally or build the project yourself:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
